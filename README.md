# GPX React

> View, Edit & Share Geodata using React & Material UI

This is a React Progressive Web App. It uses data created using a Garmin Decent Dive computer/watch. You can create compatable data (.gpx) with pretty much any smart device for free. Upload and make it more fun here.

```html
<noscript>You'll need a Lot more JavaScript to run this</noscript>
    <div id="gpx-react" />
```

Parts of the app are available free on GitHub public repositories. Some are not.

```javascript
const data = {
  logos: [
    { 
      label: "None",
      value: "none",
    },
    { 
      label: "DT9",
      value: "https://wei-zang.com/png/dt9.png",
    },
    {
